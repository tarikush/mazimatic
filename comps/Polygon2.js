                    {/*}     <p>Polygon has faster transaction speeds that are lower cost than on Ethereum, making it an attractive chain to use for decentralized finance applications. It's the best in class for minting NFT and running metaverse projects.</p> */}
                    <p>One of the primary issues NFT projects and users are currently facing is the cost of performing transactions on the Ethereum network. </p>
                    <p>With limitations on the number of transactions Ethereum can handle, users on the network have bid up gas prices to ensure their transactions quickly settle. </p>{/*<p>With the average cost of transferring an NFT averaging $15 at the time of writing, trading volume for NFTs has plummeted.
</p><p>Polygon changes this, allowing users to work with their NFTs without paying gas fees using what is known as a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollup.</p>
                    {/*}             <p><ul><li>Transactions are instant, and moving back to mainchain is trustless and verifiable.</li>
                    <li>Unlike other solutions, there is no need for you to own a unique L2 token to buy, sell, send, or receive NFTs.</li>
                        <li>Polygon will provide turing-complete general computation.</li>
                        <li>Polygon engine supports more then 10 000 transactions per second</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>Polygon also focuses on improving NFT liquidity to ensure as a buyer you find what you’re looking for, and as a seller you can find someone who wants your NFT. If you’re not familiar with ZK Rollups, why they’re considered the best solution for scaling on Ethereum, and want to learn more, we’d recommend Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s recent guide on Rollups.</p>
